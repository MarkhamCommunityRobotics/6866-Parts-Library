File naming style for 20DP and 32DP gears:

ToothCount.Bore.ManufacturerPart#

Examples:

28.hex375.AM0025
48.DOG.AM0022
12.CIM.VP217-3099
54.Bearing.VP217-3339
-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------
File naming style for "Special" gears:

ToothCount.Type.BoreSize.Pitch.ManufacturerPart#

Examples:

15.Bevel.hex375.12.VP217-3344
17.pinion.round196.40.AM2487
-----------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------
Key:

-CIM: An 8mm circular bore with a 2mm keyway meant
to fit on the shaft of a CIM or Mini CIM motor.

-Round: A circular bore, sometimes with a keyway.

-Hex: A hex bore meant to be driven by a live axle.

-DOG: A gear with a DOG pattern machined into a
face meant to interlock with a shifting DOG gear.

-Ballshift: A gear with a Ballshifter pattern
machined into the bore of the gear meant to
interlock with ball bearings in a ball shifter shaft.

-Bearing: A VEXPro bearing bore gear with a circular
1.125" bore meant for a bearing to be pressed in.

-Square: A square bore that goes through the AM0533.

-Worm: A spiral gear that runs perpendicularly to
the gear it drives.

-Pinion: A small gear meant to be pressed onto a 
motor.

-Bevel: An angled gear meant to interlock with its
connecting gear at an angle of 90 degrees.

-Sun: The center gear of a planetary gear system.

-WormGear: A gear that is driven by a Worm.

-RingGear: An internally toothed gear used in as
the outside of a planetary gear system.

-VP: Denotes a VEXPro/WCP gear.

-AM: Denotes an AndyMark gear.

NOTE: Some of the gears had do be made myself,
since their webpage did not provide sufficient
information or a CAD model. I did my best with
the little information I had, so if you find an
error, please excuse it, and contact me (either
through CD or my email) with a description of
the inaccuracy and a suggestion on how to fix it.

Materials:
For some reason, some of the Solidworks models are
not retaining their assigned materials. If this is
the case, feel free to assign them yourself with the
materials listed below. I apologize for this
inconvenience.

-VEXPro/WCP Gears are 7075 T6 Aluminum.
-VEXPro/WCP Pinions are generally 4041* steel.
-AndyMark Steel gears are 4041* steel.
-AndyMark Aluminum gears are 6061 T6 Aluminum.

*If your CAD program does not have 4041 steel
as a usable material, 4043 is similar in 
properties and works as a good substitute.

-----------------------------------------------------
Colors:

In the event you need the RGB value of the VEXPro/
WCP gears, the value can be found here:

R 255
G 255
B 192

VEXPro pinions are generally a dark, matte black,
so RGB values of 0,0,0 work, although if you want
an easier to see color, I would suggest modeling
with RGB values of 64,64,64 for a nice dark grey.

Most AndyMark gears do not have added color, however
some gears are made with a black coating. This black
is the same as the pinions above, and both RGB
values of 0,0,0 and 64,64,64 will work well.

Thank you very much for using my gear library, and I
hope you find it useful. I plan on updating it if
a large group of new gears comes out from any of the
major FRC manufacturers, so if that happens, give me
a few days to make all the gears and organize 
everything. As always, feedback is greatly
appreciated, and questions/comments/concerns can be
sent to the contact information written above or
posted to the Chief Delphi thread which I will be
making in the next few minutes.
